# docker_node_production
Ubuntu + nodejs. Ads entry point as default to run a node script.

Based on soulmaneller/nodejs

This repo runs as production mode, it adds an entry point to the installed version of node (as NVM installs the latest)

This script runs index.js by default but can be overriden by passing a parameter.
Can also pass bash as a parameter to start in terminal for debugging
